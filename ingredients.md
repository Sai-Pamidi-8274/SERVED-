//the ingredients are pretty simple
//Cavatappi. Actually, any pasta works, but cavatappi is fun to eat and especially fun to say. Feel free to use rotini, rigatoni, bow-tie, whatever ya got. 
//Small to medium sized pasta works best, especially for little mouths.
//Tomatoes. 
whole diced tomatoes, or a handful of cherry tomatoes, cut in half.
//Mushrooms Optional, but so, so good.
//Pesto. Homemade or store-bought. Here is a kale version too.
//Parmesan cheese. Grated, if you please.
//Chicken broth.
//Heavy cream. This makes the pasta delightfully creamy and irresistible.
//Olive oil. Because all good things start with a little olive oil.
//Salt. For salting the pasta water.
