//This is step by step to make this amazing dish!

//FIRST you have to cook your pasta, so heat a large pot with at least 4 quarts of generously salted water to boiling.

//QUESTION? : Why do you salt pasta water? Salting the water increases the boiling point of the water, but it also gently seasons the pasta, which means that you can use less salt overall in the recipe.

//Helpful tip: In this recipe, you can use a little bit of the pasta water in place of chicken broth, in case you’re making a vegetarian version, or you don’t have any chicken stock. The starches in the pasta water make the recipe rich and even creamier.

//Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and sauté the mushrooms and tomatoes until the mushrooms release their liquid and the tomatoes are heated through.

//Next, stir in the broth and cream(you can add wine also to make it yummier, not reccomended for kids under the age of 20) and bring everything to a boil. Turn down the heat and reduce the mixture until the sauce has thickened slightly. This should take about two minutes.

//After that, add the pesto and give the sauce a stir. Cook for another couple minutes.

//Once the pasta is cooked, add it to the sauce and gently toss until the sauce finds all the nooks and crannies in the pasta.

//Then all you have to do is serve it up in big bowls and garnish with grated Parmesan. Magnifico!
